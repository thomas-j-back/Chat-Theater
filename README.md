# Chat Theater

While working on demos that required texting examples, I realized there's no
quick tool to simulate running through a script of different actors that
communicate, send texts to each other

## How to run

This is a classic and simple vite/react app, just do `npm run dev`

## Features

First iteration will allow adding actor(text senders), assigning them roles
(sides of screen) and a sequenced script! and timing!

## Future Updates

I plan to allow customizable chat uis that represent popular and historical uis
(think classic Iphone bubbles)
