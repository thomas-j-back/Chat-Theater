# Chat Theater

While working on demos that required texting examples, I realized there's no
quick tool to simulate running through a script of different actors that
communicate, send texts to each other

## How to run

This is a classic and simple vite/react app, just do `npm run dev`

## Features

### How to use

1. Open "Edit Script" and add lines/Characters to your script
2. You may edit the timing and typing bubble durations
3. Close out the script editor and press play!

First iteration will allow adding actor(text senders), assigning them roles
(sides of screen) and a sequenced script! and timing!

## Future Updates

I plan to allow customizable chat uis that represent popular and historical uis
(think classic Iphone bubbles)
